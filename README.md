# Working Hour Analysis

**Motivation and Project Idea**
I have noticed that my daily schedule varies with both my sleep patterns and the weather. In particular, my working hours—i.e., the time I actively spend on tasks each day—seem to shift based on how well I slept the night before or the prevailing weather conditions (such as temperature, cloudiness, and precipitation). Through this project, I plan to investigate these factors together to see if my productivity can be optimized or if certain environmental or personal conditions might hinder my ability to work effectively.

**Dataset Information**

* For My Working Hours:
- I will manually track them in a excel file that i filled by myself.

* For My Sleeping Hours: 
- I will try tracking them by Apple Healt applications sleeping data. But if data i fetched is not proper or has errors i will start to track manually my sleeping hours.

* For Weather(temperature, precipitation, cloud cover):
- I will fetch online API`s to track those datas.
